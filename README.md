**Optimal Strategy for a Card Game using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**
This project finds the optimal strategy for a specific strategic card game by modeling it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). It includes an MDP solver with two planning algorithms and an encoder/decoder system to interface with the game.
